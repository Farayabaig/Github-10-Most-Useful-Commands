GitHub is a powerful platform for hosting, sharing, and collaborating on software projects. As a developer, you may find yourself using GitHub on a regular basis to manage your code and collaborate with others. Learning GitHub early on is beneficial for developers because:

•	GitHub is a popular platform for collaboration, making it easier for developers to work with others on a project.

•	GitHub offers version control, allowing developers to keep track of changes to their code over time, making it easier to revert to previous versions if necessary.

•	GitHub can serve as a portfolio, allowing developers to showcase their work to potential employers or clients.

•	GitHub hosts many open-source projects, providing opportunities for developers to contribute to projects and learn from others.

•	GitHub has a large community of developers who share knowledge, ask and answer questions, and provide support to one another. 
Here are 10 of the most popular GitHub commands along with their usage in code, that you should know.


1.	git clone
The git clone command allows you to make a local copy of a remote repository. This is useful when you want to work on a project that is hosted on GitHub. You can clone the repository to your local machine and make changes to it, which can then be pushed back to the remote repository.
Command: git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git

2.	git add
The git add command allows you to stage changes that you have made to your local repository. Once you have added your changes, you can then commit them to the repository.
	Command: git add 
	
3.	git commit
The git commit command allows you to commit your changes to the repository. You can add a commit message to describe the changes that you have made.
	Command: git commit -m "commit message"
	
4.	git push
The git push command allows you to push your local changes to the remote repository. This will update the remote repository with your changes.
	Command: git push origin master

5.	git pull

6.	git branch

	Command: git branch new-branch
	
7.	git checkout
The git checkout command allows you to switch between different branches in your repository. This is useful when you want to work on a different branch or check the status of a different branch.
	Command: git checkout new-branch
	
8.	git merge
The git merge command allows you to merge changes from one branch into another branch. This is useful when you want to incorporate changes made on a feature branch into the main branch of the project.
	Command: git merge branch-to-merge
	
9.	git status
The git status command allows you to see the status of your local repository. You can see which files have been modified, which files have been added, and which files have been deleted.
	Command: git status
	
10.	git log
The git log command allows you to see a history of the commits that have been made to the repository. You can see who made the commit, when it was made, and the commit message that was added.
	Command: git status
	
These are just a few of the most popular GitHub commands. As you become more familiar with GitHub, you will likely find other commands that are useful for your workflow.
